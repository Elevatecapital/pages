    What does the Your Investment figure represent and how is it calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Your Investment figure represents the total amount of deposit, or equity, required to purchase the property in addition to any loan taken out. It is calculated as the total Project Cost (Purchase Price + Deal Costs + Development Costs) less the amount of loan finance arranged. Annualised and total return statistics are based on the Your Investment amount.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is Net Monthly Income calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Net Monthly Income figure is the average estimated income available to investors from rental activity after all operating and finance costs are deducted. It indicates the forecasted "stabilised" income after the initial set-up and development periods (if any) and is based on the average annual income between years 2 and 5. For Company Holdings it is after corporation tax. The figure displayed is based on which ownership basis (Personal or Company holding), and which tax scenario you have selected.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is Net Annual Income calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Net Annual Income figure is the Net Monthly Income figure (see definition) over a 12 month period, based on the average annual income between years 2 and 5.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is the Annualised Return figure calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Annualised Return figure represents the average annual return on investment over a 5-year period (or whichever period is selected in the case of Flip projects). It takes into consideration all net monthly income as and when it occurs, and any capital gain or loss at the end of the period, less the costs of selling the underlying property, and generates a return percentage based on the amount of the investment (the Your Investment, or equity, figure). The figure displayed is based on which ownership basis (Personal or Company holding), and which tax scenario you have selected.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is the Total 5-Year Return figure calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Total 5-Year Return figure represents the total return on investment, and is calculated by dividing the sum of the net proceeds of the sale of the property and net income to date by the Your Investment figure (equivalent to the equity or deposit). The figure displayed is based on which ownership basis (Personal or Company holding), and which tax scenario you have selected.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    What does the Uplift and Assets figure in the chart include?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Uplift and Assets figure includes several items: (1) Any uplift in the value of the property as a result of setting a higher Resale Value (generally justified by improvements to the property such as adding a new kitchen or ensuite, or redecorating, the cost of which is captured in the Development section); (2) the addition of assets such as a Furniture Pack (the value of which will be depreciated over a 60 month period); and (3) the addition of a Reserve Fund to cover ad hoc repair and maintenance costs (the fund is assumed to be depleted over a 60 month period).

    What is the difference between the Personal holding and the Company holding settings?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Personal holding setting assumes that the property is purchased and held directly by an individual, whereas the Company holding setting assumes that a limited company has been used to purchase and hold the property. With the Personal holding setting, the individual owning the property is liable for income and capital gains tax on the property at their marginal rates. Between April 2017 and April 2020, tax relief on interest charges on mortgages will be gradually phased out for individual owners, which will increase the amount of income tax payable on earnings from properties purchased with a mortgage. Company holdings are not affected, although corporation tax is due on income generated by the property. Whilst the returns tool helps compare the relative profitability of Personal and Company holding approaches in a variety of scenarios, Investors should take their own tax advice on which approach is the most suitable in their case. 
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How do the Before Tax, Basic Rate, Higher Rate and Additional Rate settings work?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The returns tool calculates the amount of tax payable on income and capital gains before and after the deduction of personal tax, depending on whether the property is a Personal or Company holding. Each tax band setting (eg Basic Rate) assumes that the property owner (or the owner of the Company holding the property) has no other income within that rate threshold, and that the entire threshold available is applicable to the property income. In the event that the net rental income from the property exceeds the amount of that rate threshold, the excess income is charged at the next, higher applicable rate (ie at the Higher Rate if the Basic Rate amount has been exceeded). Gains on the sale of the property in the case of Personal holdings are taxed at the marginal rate applicable once net rental income has been taken into consideration. The returns tool assumes that the individual's Personal Allowance has, however, been used elsewhere. For Company holdings, a Dividend Allowance, currently Â£5,000 per annum, is applied to net income from the property holding company before any personal tax liability is calculated. For Company holdings, gains on the sale of the underlying property are subject to corporation tax, and company shareholders pay tax on dividends made upon the distribution of the sales proceeds. Investors should take their own tax advice when conducting due diligence on a potential property purpose.

  Purchase Cost
</h3>
<div class="ui attached segment">

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    What is included in Deal Costs?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Deal Costs include conveyancing costs (legal, search and Land Registry fees), property broker sourcing fees (assumed to be zero), stamp duty and finance arrangement fees. Costs are based on the size of the transaction.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is Project Cost calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Project Cost is the total cost of the investment project, including purchase price, conveyancing costs, stamp duty, finance arrangement fees and any development costs.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    What is the Reserve Fund?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Reserve Fund is an amount of cash set aside at the time of the purchase of the property to cover ongoing repairs and maintenance. It is prudent to create a reserve fund to cover potential costs during at least the first 12 months of rental operations, based on the size and condition of the property. Reserve Fund amounts in the forecasts are spread over a 60 month period, so that 1/60th of the amount is assumed to have been used each month.

    What is Gross Yield and how is it calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Gross Yield is a widely used indicator of the relative gross revenue potential of a property investment. It is used to compare the potential returns from properties within the same strategy or across different strategies, and in different locations, before the attribution of operating costs. It is calculated by dividing gross annual rental revenue by the total cost of the investment (Project Cost), and takes into consideration development costs.
  </p>

    How does the Void Months setting work?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Void Months setting is used for Buy-to-let and HMO strategies and determines how many months of the year that the property is expected to be unoccupied, and therefore not generating any income. The setting is applied to years 2 to 5, and helps estimate the impact of loss of revenues between the end of one tenancy and the start of another. The Void Months setting is is not applied in the first year, as a 1 month void is automatically applied to the first year income due to the likelihood that it will take several weeks to have a tenant in place following the completion of a purchase. 
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How does the Occupancy setting work?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Occupancy setting is used for the AirBnB strategy and determines how many nights each month that the property is expected to be unoccupied, and therefore not generating any income. The setting is applied to all years.

    What is Resale Value and how does it impact projected returns?
  </h4>
  <p>
   Resale Value is equivalent to Gross Development Value, or the value of the property once all development work has been completed. It represents the gross sale price that could reasonably be expected in current market conditions for a comparable property. Resale Value determines the profit made on the total Project Cost, including any development work carried out. It is used as the basis for the future price growth of the property (as determined by the Annual Price Growth slider). Together with the Development Cost slider, Resale Value also drives the Value Added and Profit Added indicators.

    What is Value Added and how is it calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Value Added represents the gross profit made on the initial investment once all development work has been completed. It is calculated as Resale Value less Project Cost.
