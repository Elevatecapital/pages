    What is the Reserve Fund?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Reserve Fund is an amount of cash set aside at the time of the purchase of the property to cover ongoing repairs and maintenance. It is prudent to create a reserve fund to cover potential costs during at least the first 12 months of rental operations, based on the size and condition of the property. Reserve Fund amounts in the forecasts are spread over a 60 month period, so that 1/60th of the amount is assumed to have been used each month.

    What does the Your Investment figure represent and how is it calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Your Investment figure represents the total amount of deposit, or equity, required to purchase the property in addition to any loan taken out. It is calculated as the total Project Cost (Purchase Price + Deal Costs + Development Costs) less the amount of loan finance arranged. Annualised and total return statistics are based on the Your Investment amount.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is Net Monthly Income calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Net Monthly Income figure is the average estimated income available to investors from rental activity after all operating and finance costs are deducted. It indicates the forecasted "stabilised" income after the initial set-up and development periods (if any) and is based on the average annual income between years 2 and 5. For Company Holdings it is after corporation tax. The figure displayed is based on which ownership basis (Personal or Company holding), and which tax scenario you have selected.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is Net Annual Income calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Net Annual Income figure is the Net Monthly Income figure (see definition) over a 12 month period, based on the average annual income between years 2 and 5.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is the Annualised Return figure calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Annualised Return figure represents the average annual return on investment over a 5-year period (or whichever period is selected in the case of Flip projects). It takes into consideration all net monthly income as and when it occurs, and any capital gain or loss at the end of the period, less the costs of selling the underlying property, and generates a return percentage based on the amount of the investment (the Your Investment, or equity, figure). The figure displayed is based on which ownership basis (Personal or Company holding), and which tax scenario you have selected.
  </p>

  <h4 class="ui dividing header">
    How is the Total 5-Year Return figure calculated?
  </h4>
  <p>
    The Total 5-Year Return figure represents the total return on investment, and is calculated by dividing the sum of the net proceeds of the sale of the property and net income to date by the Your Investment figure (equivalent to the equity or deposit). The figure displayed is based on which ownership basis (Personal or Company holding), and which tax scenario you have selected.
